## little things

Motley assortment of little programs in various states of completion without a more proper home. Brief descriptions:

* bayes.py: Bayesian search. Was using it to explore different methods.
* v_cipher.py: Vigen√®re cipher encryption / decryption script. Supports multiple keywords.
* sha1.py: Really bad SHA1 implementation. Mostly just me learning about the algorithm.
* stap.y: Python implementation of the transcription factor binding model in [this PLOS paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008155).
* ytloop.sh: Downloads a video from youtube and loops a particular segment of it as many times as you want.
